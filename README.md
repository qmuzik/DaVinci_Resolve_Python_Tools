# DaVinci_Resolve_Python_Tools
I have developed Python Scripts for DaVinci Resolve to speed up workflows. 

Each Folder is a tool that can be added to your DaVinci Tool shelf. Download the folder and save the script to your DaVinci shelf to use the tool. 

Here is a description of what each DaVinci Tool does:

- Template Generator: Allows users to select a premade project setup template based on project type and automates project setup, media import, and appending media to timeline via a User Interface.
- Project Setup Scripts: Automates Project Setup for project types, media import, and appending media to the timeline. These serve as a baseline for templates used in the template generator.
